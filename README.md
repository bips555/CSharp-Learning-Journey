This repository is a  categorized and organized collection of C# projects, tutorials, and exercises. It represents a progressive journey, capturing fundamental concepts, advanced topics, and practical implementations of C# programming. The repository is divided into distinct folders to provide a clear and structured learning path, making it easy to explore various aspects of C#.

Repository Structure and Description
1. C# Basics
This folder focuses on foundational concepts for beginners to build a strong understanding of C# programming. Projects here emphasize simple yet important principles such as data handling, decision-making, and debugging.
Subfolders:
HelloWorld: Introduction to C# with the classic "Hello, World!" program.
VariablesAndDataTypes: Explore C# variables and their associated data types.
MakingDecisions: Control flow using if-else and switch statements.
Methods: Learn to define and use methods for modular code.
Properties: Understanding properties in classes for encapsulation.
Debugging: Techniques for identifying and resolving errors in C# code.

2. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
Dedicated to the core principles of OOP, this folder showcases the implementation of encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction through real-world examples.
Subfolders:
ClassAndObjects: Basics of creating and interacting with classes and objects.
StructAndClass: Differences and uses of structs and classes.
Inheritance: Demonstrates class inheritance and code reuse.
Polymorphism: Implementation of method overriding and dynamic behavior.
DelegatesAndEvents: Event-driven programming using delegates.
Interface: Abstraction using interfaces for designing modular applications.


3. Collections
This section dives into C# collections and data structures, providing practical implementations of managing, organizing, and manipulating data.
Subfolders:
Arrays: Basics of array data structures.
StacksDemo: Operations and applications of stacks.
QueueDemo: FIFO implementation using queues.
DictionariesDemo: Key-value pair management with dictionaries.
JaggedArray: Working with arrays of arrays.
TicTacToe: A simple game demonstrating the application of collections.


4. LINQ
Focused on querying and manipulating data efficiently, this folder covers LINQ’s integration with C# for various data sources such as XML, SQL, and in-memory collections.
Subfolders:
Linq1stExample: Introduction to LINQ queries.
LinqWithXML: Querying XML files with LINQ.
LinqToSql: Integration of LINQ with SQL databases.
LinqUniversityManager: Practical use case for managing data with LINQ.


5. Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF)
This folder features projects focusing on creating visually rich desktop applications with WPF, showcasing UI design, event triggers, and data binding.
Subfolders:
WPFZooManager: A desktop application for managing zoo data.
WPFCheckbox: Demonstrates checkbox functionalities in WPF.
ToolTip: Adding tooltips to enhance user interface usability.
WPF RadioButton and Images: Leveraging radio buttons with image handling in WPF.


6. Advanced C# Topics
Advanced topics designed to deepen understanding and prepare for real-world scenarios. This includes threading, file operations, and application-specific concepts.
Subfolders:
ThreadBasics: Basics of multithreading in C#.
FILEIOC: File input and output operations for data handling.
PropertyDataAndEventTriggers: Advanced property management in WPF.


Purpose and Learning Goals
This repository represents my journey as I strive to master C#. It not only reflects my growth as a developer but also serves as a resource for others looking to learn and explore C#. By dividing projects into categories like Basics, OOP, Collections, LINQ, WPF, and Advanced Topics, I aim to make this repository a well-rounded and accessible guide for C# learners.
