Subfolders:

HelloWorld: Introduction to C# with the classic "Hello, World!" program.

VariablesAndDataTypes: Explore C# variables and their associated data types.

MakingDecisions: Control flow using if-else and switch statements.

Methods: Learn to define and use methods for modular code.

Properties: Understanding properties in classes for encapsulation.

Debugging: Techniques for identifying and resolving errors in C# code.


2. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
   
Dedicated to the core principles of OOP, this folder showcases the implementation of encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction through real-world examples.

Subfolders:

ClassAndObjects: Basics of creating and interacting with classes and objects.

StructAndClass: Differences and uses of structs and classes.

Inheritance: Demonstrates class inheritance and code reuse.

Polymorphism: Implementation of method overriding and dynamic behavior.

DelegatesAndEvents: Event-driven programming using delegates.

Interface: Abstraction using interfaces for designing modular applications.


3. Collections
   
This section dives into C# collections and data structures, providing practical implementations of managing, organizing, and manipulating data.

Subfolders:

Arrays: Basics of array data structures.

StacksDemo: Operations and applications of stacks.

QueueDemo: FIFO implementation using queues.

DictionariesDemo: Key-value pair management with dictionaries.

JaggedArray: Working with arrays of arrays.

WPFCheckbox: Demonstrates checkbox functionalities in WPF.

ToolTip: Adding tooltips to enhance user interface usability.

WPF RadioButton and Images: Leveraging radio buttons with image handling in WPF.


6. Advanced C# Topics
   
Advanced topics designed to deepen understanding and prepare for real-world scenarios. This includes threading, file operations, and application-specific concepts.

Subfolders:

ThreadBasics: Basics of multithreading in C#.

FILEIOC: File input and output operations for data handling.

PropertyDataAndEventTriggers: Advanced property management in WPF.


Purpose and Learning Goals

This repository represents my journey as I strive to master C#. It not only reflects my growth as a developer but also serves as a resource for others looking to learn and explore C#. By dividing projects into categories like Basics, OOP, Collections, LINQ, WPF, and Advanced Topics, I aim to make this repository a well-rounded and accessible guide for C# learners.
